# Java Appointment Calendar 
This is a java project for my 2-part first year course at Ryerson university, it's an appointment calendar application with a working GUI to set appointments on certain dates. Also features an address book to add contacts for specific dates. The idea of the project was to emphasize the use of object oriented programming. Multiple classes were created to finish this project.
